  <div id="me">
     
    <p> I hail from the land of Greenleaf in the providence of Idaho. I have lived there all 30 years of my life with a brief hiatus to the Oregon coast. I am an outdoor enthusiast, especially when it comes to fly fishing. I also love sports and can either be found on the golf course or at home watching football. Fall is my favorite time of year because the mountains are empty of people and football is on. I have also play bass guitar for my church and keeps me busy!</p>




      
      <p>I am married to the most beautiful woman in the world. Her name is Brie. We are expecting our first child the end of February 2021. We just recently found out it is a boy!</p>

      <p>I am excited for this new journey of becoming a software developer!
